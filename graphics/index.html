<h4>Dear Worried Parent,</h4>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like every parent I talk to (and most college-bound kids), you&rsquo;re worried sick about paying for college.</p>
<p>You probably don&rsquo;t even want to think about it.</p>
<p>Maybe you, like most parents I meet, put off planning because you just don&rsquo;t see any way you could come up with an extra $30,000&ndash;$60,000 a year for a top-notch school.</p>
<p>Believe me, I&rsquo;ve heard many, many parents and their children say they have<em> no hope</em> for achieving a four-year degree.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m here to tell you the truth: IT&rsquo;S ALL BALONEY.</p>
<p>Everyone&mdash;and I mean EVERYONE&mdash;can get a four-year degree, even with mediocre grades.</p>
<p>I can say that because I&rsquo;m living proof.</p>
<p>My name is Trevor Ramos. Not so long ago, I was in the same boat.</p>
<p>I grew up with my mom in Garland, Texas. I was a football jock and a mediocre student. My GPA was a &ldquo;stellar&rdquo; 2.8.</p>
<p>My high school teachers and counselors were no help. All of them told me that community college was my best bet.</p>
<p><em>Basically, they told me I wasn&rsquo;t college material.</em></p>
<p style="width: 500px;">That made me mad&hellip; <img src="images/really.jpg" style="float: right;" /></p>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
<p>I always assumed I was going to college. I knew I was smart enough.</p>
<p>I also knew my mom couldn&rsquo;t foot the bill.</p>
<p>But&mdash;who were they to say that college wasn&rsquo;t for me?</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I Won&rsquo;t Go to Junior College&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>There had to be a way to get the money I needed.</p>
<p>Instead of accepting what the &ldquo;experts&rdquo; told me, I dug in.</p>
<p>I was like a dog with a bone.</p>
<p>I went to the library. I called everyone I knew and people I didn&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>And I uncovered the secrets of how financial aid really works.</p>
<p>Because I didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing, it took hours and hours and hours of research&mdash;research I&rsquo;ll share with you so you can get the money you need quickly and easily.</p>
<p>What I found was astounding.</p>
<h4 style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">My teachers and counselors were dead wrong.</h4>
<p>By the time I was done with my &ldquo;blitz&rdquo; attack&hellip;</p>
<ul class="right">
<li>I was accepted into Boston University&mdash;with a 2.8 GPA!</li>
<li>I found over $150,000 in FREE money to pay my way through college</li>
<li>I graduated with under $9,000 in debt</li>
</ul>
<p>I did it--I graduated with a degree in Accounting and Management Information Systems</p>
<h4><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;" color="#FF0000">My Four-Year Degree from Boston University Cost Less than $5,000 a Year!</span></strong> <img src="images/green.jpg" style="float: right;" /></h4>
<p><em>I paid less than $5,000 a year out of my own pocket.</em><span style="width: 500px;"><img src="images/trevor.jpg" align="right" vspace="20" width="300" /></span></p>
<p>Pretty good, huh?</p>
<p>Now, you might ask yourself (I sure did), &ldquo;why did Trevor&rsquo;s teachers and counselors push so hard for community college?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer is: They didn&rsquo;t have a clue that I could pay for a four-year degree because they&rsquo;re not experts on college funding.</p>
<p>Like most people&mdash;they thought the only way to get a scholarship was to have a 4.0 GPA. They also believed the only other way to pay for college was by going into debt.</p>
<p>Boy, were they wrong. And I am so glad I didn&rsquo;t listen to them. Because here&rsquo;s what I found&hellip;</p>
<center>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/threegreen.jpg" height="92" width="128" /></p>

<h4 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 5px;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;" color="#FF0000">WHEN IT COMES TO PAYING FOR COLLEGE, any student can get thousands of dollars in FREE TUITION AND FEES&mdash;no matter how much $$ their family makes, no matter what their family assets, no matter what their GPA!</span></strong></h4>
<p>I will show you how to get a prestigious four-year degree for pennies on the dollar.</p>
<p><strong><span style="float: left; font-size: 18pt; color: #000000; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Why?</span></strong> &nbsp; Because I think it&rsquo;s criminal the lies that students are told.</p>
<p>Using my techniques, some students graduate totally debt-free from the <em>top</em> colleges in the U.S. Some end up paying a few thousand out of pocket, like I did.</p>
<p>(Here&rsquo;s a cool fact: there are great colleges that, once you are accepted, <em>make sure</em> that you have all the money you need to graduate. That&rsquo;s one of the FREE Reports I&rsquo;ll send you&mdash;just keep reading.)</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center; color: #000000;">Right now, you&rsquo;re probably scratching your head going,</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center; color: #000000;">&ldquo;Huh? Is this guy crazy?&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the deal.</p>
<center><img src="images/trevorramos.png" height="185" width="679" /></center>
<p>If you shop at Costco, you know you can get name brand merchandise for a lot less. And when you buy on sale, you know that there are great deals out there.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the same is true for a college education. There are many top-tier schools that give out &ldquo;secret&rdquo; scholarships to fill their classrooms. This &ldquo;insider&rsquo;s&rdquo; list changes year to year, and that&rsquo;s key intel that I stay on top of.</p>
<p>Now, if you know how financial aid really works, and the techniques and tricks I discovered and keep updating, you can use them to collect all the FREE money you&rsquo;ll need.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re probably thinking, &ldquo;this sounds too good to be true&hellip; what&rsquo;s the catch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The catch is, you&rsquo;ll need a sharp strategy and do some work. But, with my help, you&rsquo;ll never go through what I went through. I was like a blind man in the dark when I started out.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll get a clear, step-by-step game plan for getting the degree your child wants and deserves&mdash;and pay pennies on the dollar.</p>

<h4>This is a copy of my Award Letter from Boston University. I graduated in 2009 majoring in Accounting and Information Technology Management&mdash;not debt!</h4>
<img src="images/grant_trevor.jpg" />
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
&ldquo;I received $152,000 in FREE Scholarships &amp; Grants&hellip; with a 2.8 High School GPA!&rdquo;</div>
<div style="clear: both; height: 15px;"></div>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Don&rsquo;t You Want to Cash In on All the Scholarships and Grants You&rsquo;ll Ever Need?</h4>
<p>Because I figured out how to unlock the financial aid system&mdash;every part of it, including deadlines and the all-important &ldquo;EFC&rdquo; (Expected Family Contribution)&mdash;I found $152,000 of Scholarships &amp; Grants to graduate from Boston University, one of the top schools in the United States. <strong>This is money I never have to pay back.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>I Help Families Like Yours Everyday</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://collegefundingremedies.com/images/parents_college.jpg" /></p>
<p>Nothing my counselors and teachers told me about getting into college&mdash;or paying for it&mdash;was true.</p>
<p>And, like I said before, I&rsquo;ve seen tons of kids and their families simply give up because they believed the baloney they were fed.</p>
<p>It just isn&rsquo;t right.</p>
<p>Since graduating from Boston University, I&rsquo;ve turned my experience into College Funding Remedies. <strong>We make dreams come true with education one student at a time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Proof? We&rsquo;ve secured awards totaling over $9M for over 200 students since 2009.</strong></p>
<center>
<h3><strong>It&rsquo;s More Than Money&mdash;We&rsquo;ll Also Get Your Child Into The Perfect College</strong></h3>
</center>
<p>You&rsquo;ll finally stop worrying about paying for college while you give them the degree they want. You&rsquo;ll have the pride and security of knowing your child is well-launched.</p>
<p>You won&rsquo;t believe the self-confidence they&rsquo;ll have when they get their degree and find their place in the world.</p>
<p>I love watching the students I&rsquo;ve worked with get a jump-start on life that very few people in the U.S. have&mdash;without being enslaved to a lifetime of debt.</p>
<p>My students develop a thirst for knowledge and life-long learning that gives them a leg up in any career or life situation.</p>
<p>All of these things are possible for your child because I&rsquo;ll help you find every dime of FREE MONEY available to pay for tuition and expenses.</p>
<h4>What Ken and Sandra wrote me after working with their daughter Camilla&hellip;</h4>
<div class="module">
<h3 align="center">What one student's happy parents wrote to Trevor&hellip;</h3>
<p align="center"><em>"Trevor, we just wanted to contact you to say thanks. Camilla has decided to go to <strong>Tulane University</strong>. It was your suggestion that got her interested in the school, so we are very appreciative of your input. The advice and feedback you provided to Camilla in the admissions process was very helpful. <strong>Camilla received merit scholarships for $68,000, plus another $22,000 in financial aid (total amount over 4 years).</strong> Again, thanks for your valuable help. Best wishes, Ken &amp; Sandra"</em></p>
</div>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Now that you know college can be free or cost next to nothing&hellip; you need to know how to do it.</h4>
<center><img src="images/5big.jpg" /></center>
<p><strong>MYTH #1: </strong>You have to have straight A&rsquo;s and a perfect SAT score to get scholarships and tuition assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Reality</strong> &lsquo;Trevor has consistently found over $60,000 in scholarship money for students with GPAs as low as 2.4 (Remember, Trevor got $170,000 from BU, and he nosed his way in with a 2.8 GPA.) There are schools like Pitzer College that give out merit scholarships with absolutely no regard for SAT Scores.</p>
<p>You see, these days getting into college is much more than GPA and SATs. Having a unique &ldquo;X-factor&rdquo; can make a college accept you and give you money over another student.</p>
<p>We are experts in identifying your child&rsquo;s unique X-factor.</p>
<p>For example: The school may be looking for female neuroscience majors, or engineers or people from a particular part of the United States.</p>
<p>Plus, much of financial aid is based on need and not on merit. That means that as long as you get into a school, they will (with some exceptions) give you all the money that you need.</p>
<p><strong><img src="images/cap.jpg" align="right" height="283" width="424" />MYTH #2:</strong> You have to spend all of your savings, all of your discretionary income, and your entire retirement fund to pay for your child&rsquo;s education.</p>
<p><strong>REALITY:</strong> If you just spend the time planning out your college approach and understand which schools will give you the most money, your out of pocket cost will drop like a stone.</p>
<p>Let me help you plan and execute a sound strategy built for your family. With the right plan, you will not need to touch your retirement assets, home equity, or discretionary income. <strong style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="#form2" style="text-decoration: none;">For the information you need,</a></strong> ask for the four <strong style="color: #0033ff;"><a href="#form2" style="text-decoration: none;">FREE Reports</a></strong> valued at nearly $150.00 (priceless if you follow the step-by-step advice).</p>
<h4 style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Believe it or not, most colleges do not want you to use retirement resources or home equity. They don&rsquo;t want your family&rsquo;s financial health endangered.</h4>
<p>Sadly, most parents will do it anyway because they just don&rsquo;t know what else to do, but they want to give their child a great future.</p>
<h4 style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Information is power when it comes to paying for college.</h4>
<p><strong>MYTH #3:</strong> Your family has to be broke to get any kind of assistance.</p>
<p><strong>REALITY:</strong> Most colleges would rather give a discount to a family that can pay something, than give a 100% scholarship to a family that needs thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>There are specific schools that are a good match for you based on your family category type. We have that list. We know exactly which school makes the most sense for your child and your situation. It&rsquo;s in the package of four <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a href="#form2" style="text-decoration: none;">FREE Reports</a></strong></span> you can claim</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s a little cynical but true: colleges know that a high income family is more likely to donate to the school later, so they often prefer to give financial aid to those families.</p>
<p><strong>MYTH #4</strong>: Top-tier colleges and universities rarely give out scholarships and grants. They don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p><strong>REALITY</strong>: The most difficult schools to get into have the biggest endowment funds.</p>
<p>They give out the most money to students, as long as you can get in. It is true that some of these schools will not give out merit aid because, let&rsquo;s face it, every single kid that got into Harvard, Stanford, and MIT deserves a full ride and they can&rsquo;t give a full scholarship to everybody.</p>
<p>However, if the school doesn&rsquo;t give out merit scholarships, <strong>we have identified the top 400 Universities and Liberal Arts Colleges in the US that will essentially bid for this student and give them as close to a full or half ride as possible. </strong>You can find out who those schools are in your four <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><a href="#form2" style="text-decoration: none;">FREE Reports</a></strong></span>.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t understand how elite and prestigious these schools are. They include:</p>
<ul class="red">
<li>Tulane University</li>
<li>George Washington University</li>
<li>New York University</li>
<li>Duke University</li>
<li>Claremont McKenna College</li>
<li>Boston University</li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip; and so many more. If they can get your student to come to their school, it will increase their ranking with publications like<strong><em> U.S. News &amp; World Report.</em></strong> That&rsquo;s worth a lot of money to them.</p>
<p>To get our list of 20 schools that give $20,000 or more per student, <a href="#form2" style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">ask for your four FREE Reports.</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of four Reports in our <span style="color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="#form2">Funding Basics Package.</a></span> Purchased separately, you&rsquo;d have to pay nearly $150.00, but I&rsquo;ll send them to you for free&mdash;just for the asking.</p>
<h4>It&rsquo;s one of four Reports in our Funding Basics Package. Purchased separately, you&rsquo;d have to pay nearly $150.00, but I&rsquo;ll send them to you for free&mdash;just for the asking.</h4>
<p><strong>MYTH #5:</strong> Private scholarships are my best chance for paying for my child&rsquo;s education</p>
<p><strong>REALITY:</strong> Although they have their place, chasing private scholarships can be a huge waste of time. Some of these private scholarships, like the Gates Millennium Scholarship or the Coca Cola Scholarship, receive twice as many applications as Ivy League colleges.</p>
<p>Most people don&rsquo;t know this, but private scholarships comprise about 7-12% of all the free money for college, but students have a less than 1% chance of winning them.</p>
<p>By comparison, a student has about an 8% chance of getting into Yale University.</p>
<p>And, believe it or not, the average private scholarship is less than $2,000, which isn&rsquo;t even enough to pay for living expenses, let alone tuition.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also usually a one-year, one-time award.</p>
<p>It just makes me sad to see so many families spend hours and hours on the Internet, searching and applying for scholarships that are receiving applications from all over the world. These families have no idea how competitive these scholarships really are.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">The Truth About Private Scholarships</h4>
<p>If you want private scholarship money, here&rsquo;s how: find the ones that are in your community. You are more likely to win those because the competition is lower.</p>
<p>Secondly, instead of spending hours and hours of time looking up private scholarships on sites like fastweb.com and scholarships.com, spend that time finding good schools for you child that will give you at least $20,000 in scholarship money and financial aid, year after year.</p>
<p>(This list is part of the free <span style="color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="#form2">Funding Basics Package</a></span> we will send to you - almost $150.00 in valuable information, just for the asking.)</p>
<p>The big money is out there&mdash;and a lot easier to get than you think!</p>

<p>Information is the solution.</p>
<p>Most parents are not in a position to just write a check for a pricey college education.</p>
<p>Even if you are&mdash;you shouldn&rsquo;t! Why pay your hard-earned dollars and potentially compromise your standard of living or retirement funds when there&rsquo;s plenty of free scholarships and awards for your child&mdash;when you know how to find them?</p>
<p>High school counselors and teachers don&rsquo;t know the first thing about helping you pay for your child&rsquo;s education&mdash;other than taking out an expensive loan or getting merit scholarships.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s hard to find out what tactics will work for you.</strong> And most parents are so afraid they&rsquo;ll hear &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t help you&rdquo; they get paralyzed with fear&hellip; and often just give up. It&rsquo;s hard to ask intelligent questions when you&rsquo;re already convinced the answer is &ldquo;NO!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again, I am the<em> only</em> college planner who will give you this information without cost or obligation. Some of my colleagues won&rsquo;t show you this information until you&rsquo;ve paid thousands of dollars in fees.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s right. These reports will help your student make the right choices and get the grants and awards you need to pay for their degree&mdash;and start a great career.</p>
<h4>All four <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="#form3" style="text-decoration: none;">Reports</a></span> are yours at no cost or obligation. Just valuable information you can use immediately.</h4>
